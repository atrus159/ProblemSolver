ProblemSolver

By: Darius Rudominer

A program that finds common solutions to technical or programming problems, by searching for a consensus among programming help forums.

How to use:

1.) Make sure you have a .env file that contains a valid OPENAI_API_KEY and METAPHOR_API_KEY, in an accessible folder higher than this one

2.) Make sure you have metaphor_python, openai and dotenv installed. To install these, run "pip install [package name]" from your command terminal

3.) Run "python3 ProblemSolver.py" from your command terminal in this folder

4.) Type in a description (ideally one or two sentences) of a technical problem you are having

The program will then search through up to ten forum posts for promising-looking answers, and provide you with a digest of its findings.
